# verifying-uart-using-uvm
	1- Verifying UART Module that contains Tx, Rx, and baud rate generator blocks.
	2- Creating complete environment (sequencer, driver, monitor and scoreboard).
 	3- The environment contains two agents, one for transmitting mode and the other for receiving mode.
	4- Immediate and concurrent assertions.
	5- Using virtual sequence & virtual sequencer to control the two agents.
	6- Using Factory Override to override components inside the tx_agent to create the rx_agent.
 	7- Applying Constaints to the randomization.
  	8- Functional Coverage.
